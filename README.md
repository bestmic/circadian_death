## Abstract
**Background**
Many studies have revealed the circadian pattern of sudden cardiac death. However, only small studies provided data regarding circadian rhythm in the temporal distribution of cancer death. We modeled the time of cancer death and examined if the circadian rhythm existed.
**Methods**  
We used parametric and nonparametric methods, including trigonometric regression in the framework of generalized linear models, to test the presence of circadian rhythms in the time of cancer death among 58,451 patients in public hospitals of Hong Kong.
**Results**  
We found evidence of circadian patterns among our cancer patients (Z = -0.04; P value = 0.48). The highest frequency of death occurred at 06 h 00 min (4.90%) and 20 h 00 min (4.87%), and the lowest frequency at 18 h 00 min (3.66%). The morning and evening peaks showed 1.3 times higher frequency of death than the reference time 00 h 00 min (prevalence ratios for 06 h 00 min and 20 h 00 min = 1.3, 95% CI 0.8, 2.2).
**Conclusion**  
Although circadian patterns of cancer death were detected in several studies, they could not be confirmed in our study, which comprised a large sample size and was analyzed using modern and robust statistical methods. Future studies can be conducted to confirm our findings and assess the factors affecting the temporal distribution of cancer death. 
**Impact**
The time of cancer death is a random process.
